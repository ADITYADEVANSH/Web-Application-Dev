Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to "finish" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such
BUT... it was a great way to end several major storylines that marvel invested in over the past 11 years. 
What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable
